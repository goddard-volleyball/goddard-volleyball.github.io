### Developers
- Host: `Github pages`
- Pre-processor: `zola`
    - this is a super useful tool that generates the site for us from all the templates so we don't have to write as much code or copy paste
- Style-processor: `sass` (built into zola)
    - this is a preprocessor for css styles, making the syntax much easier
- Data Processing: `terra` (built into zola)
    - this is a language built into zola that can do things with our data files or further assist in generating individual files
- Libraries: `bootstrap`
    - this is a super useful framework that further helps with skeleton (html) items and does a lot of the heavy lifting for the styles within the html (.mb-3 translates to margin-bottom: 15px for instance)

#### Local hosting commands
```bash
zola serve
```

#### Structure
- .github -> folder for github workflows to deploy site from github actions
- config.toml -> zola site global options file
- content -> content to process and include within the templates
- public -> autogenerated folder where processed site is placed
- sass -> styles folder
- static -> content that isn't changing or requires any processing
- templates -> layouts and components to include anywhere to prevent repetition
